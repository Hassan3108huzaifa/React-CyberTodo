# Cyber Todo

**Cyber Todo** is a simple and effective todo list application built with React. It’s my first React project and is designed to work seamlessly across all devices. The app includes a local storage system, ensuring that todos are saved even when the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works well on all devices, from desktop to mobile.
- **Local Storage Integration:** Your tasks are saved in your browser’s local storage, so they remain intact even after a page refresh.
- **Task Management:** Add, complete, and delete tasks easily with a user-friendly interface.
- **Modern UI:** A sleek and modern design with a cyber-themed look.
